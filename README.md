# Illustrative Example of Potential Scala Bugs

This repository contains a simple Scala program to illustrate places where bugs could occur in more complex projects.  The example is intentionally simple to focus on common error patterns.

## Potential Issues

While this specific code works, it highlights potential issues such as:

* **NullPointerExceptions:**  In larger programs, parameters might not always be initialized properly or could be null. A more robust `myMethod` might check for nulls. 
* **Type Mismatches:**  Similar to null checks, this example lacks robust type handling.  Improper input types could lead to runtime errors. 
* **Concurrency Issues:**  With multiple threads, this code may present concurrency problems if  `x` were mutable and accessed from other threads without synchronization. 
* **Unexpected Side Effects:**  `myMethod` has no side effects in this instance, but in more complex scenarios, unintended side effects could make debugging harder. 
* **Exception Handling:** The absence of explicit exception handling could lead to unexpected program termination in case of errors.

## How to run

1. Ensure you have Scala installed on your machine.
2. Save the code as `MyClass.scala`.
3. Compile and run using the Scala compiler: `scalac MyClass.scala` and `scala Main`

This minimal example should help you get started.  Adapt it to your situation and extend it to explore more complex Scala concepts.
